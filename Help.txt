Hi
I included this text to get a grip on the game
I'ts nearly done just a few fixes and writing
the endgame is left after that i'ts just adding more content
and fixing popping up bugs but i'ts half playable
Hit me up with any suggestions and bug reports

Rules:
First you get 6 cards to your hand which you can see
And 3 cards which you can't
Choose 3 from the 6 visible and the choosen ones 
will be your endgame cards with the 3 hidden, you can't 
play these till the deck empties
Remaining 3 cards are your hand and you play from these
First player plays a card and the game starts(will be updated to real life version later)
The next player has to play a bigger card
This continues till the deck runs out
If someone can't play a card, the board has to be picked up by that player
and the next player plays to an empty board
This won't make it interesting but there're special type of magic and anti cards

Magic cards(and powers):
These can be put on any card except the Anti card(9)

2   -- Reset, Makes the next player play to a 2 which is the lowest numbered card essentialy reseting the board 
8   -- Glass card, next player has to play on the card below the 8 (stackable)
10  -- Burn, deletes the board and the player has to play another card to an empty board
Ace -- Ask, player has to ask another person to play a magic card and the turn skips to the asked player

Anti card:
9   -- Limit, can be played only if valid, so can't be played on a magic card, can't be played 
       on any card higher than 9 and cant be played on the 9 since 9 limits the cards that can be put
       on it from 3 to 7 

Stacking:
Player can stack any card in one turn but only if they have a same type of card
even if they drawn it in the turn they played a card(program handles this automaticaly
you just have to agree on playing the card)
Example: Play 5 of Clubs
         Draw 5 of Hearts
         Game asks for permission to auto stack
         If yes game put's card to the board and draws another one(if neccesary)
         After this board looks like : 5 C 5 H 
         And this repeats if you draw another 5(again with asked permission)

Burning:
If the players stack 4 of the same card on top of the board it gets deleted(burned)
and the player who puts the last card plays on an empty board(because he/she burned the board)


Setting up the game:
Start the fattyaWeb to make a handling server(later this will be a dedicated thing, port 6070)
Start the fattyaserver to make a table on the handle server which players can join(port is 60870)
Have friends
Start the client set a temporal account and sit to the table("join" command), than type "start"
and wait for every player to do the same and than the game will start
